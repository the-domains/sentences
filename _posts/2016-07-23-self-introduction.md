# Self Introduction

Hello!

I've been thinking of how to use this website. It would be probably very unsuitable, however, but I think I will start this as a blog.

I don't think I would use only English for progressing, I may use my first language, because that could be easier at some point.

I don't have an intension to keep all the posting forever, I may delete some of them time to time, as I see that are outdated to me, or no longer represents my ideas or simply I don't want to present it on the website.

It would be very exciting to show about me, rather than explain myself on a page

so let's start!
