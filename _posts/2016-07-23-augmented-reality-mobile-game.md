# Augmented Reality Mobile Game

I had hard the word "augmented reality" but I didn't have the idea until I saw the game "pokémon go". It became so famous and it appeared on prime time television news in the country I live. I've been long forgotten of the Pokémon world, even if it was very important friend in my youngster life. I've been collecting Pokémon plushes, (though none of them are left anymore...) and they settled as one of my peaceful childhood memory. I've been watched the anime series of course. What I have learnt recently was in the Pokemon universe, the game world was appeared first and the anime was the last. I've been thought for long the fame of anime made the game come out. I was totally wrong. Anyway, the game seemed to have developed itself along with the new technology. My country is not Pokémon service area at this time, so I can't play it, But I enjoy the anime series, watching them again after the long time of its absence.

The Pokémon series is suprisingly still on going, coming after and after new seasons. The characters are (what I see in this age of my life,) plain, but they are dramers and though stupid, but idealists who are following their dreams. (Strictly say, one of the heroes dream). I didn't watch the many seasons, because I've stopped them in my early childhood. And I'm only watching the first few seasons that I've covered earlier. I'm watching too much of the series in short time, in other word, intensively, perhaps because of it I think it's losing my interest and causes me lack of sleep and tired.

I don't know when I would stop, but anime watching is what I do these days.
